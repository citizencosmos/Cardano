Ok, that said, I think this bash script could help other newbies set up their nodes, especially when used in conjunction with Chris Graffaggnino's Guide 4 Newbs. I've mashed up some of Chris's stuff and IOHK's stuff to do some of the prep work of setting up a server and starting a node (passive or leader).

Most thanks to Chris (and his contributors), his script is what helped me set up my first pool.

Thanks to IOHK for their software and their guide.
